# Formal Wear Detection (ML-based)


A machine learning project that detects whether a person is wearing formal attire, utilizing Teachable Machine by Google for custom model training. Built with ml5.js and p5.js, the system uses supervised learning to classify clothing into formal or casual categories (e.g., suits, blazers, dress shirts). The model is trained using images labeled as formal or casual clothing on Teachable Machine, which simplifies the creation and deployment of custom models. The trained model is then integrated into the project using ml5.js, with real-time webcam input analyzed for classification. p5.js is used for rendering the interface and displaying the live feed. The system offers an interactive experience, classifying whether the user is wearing formal attire in real time.
